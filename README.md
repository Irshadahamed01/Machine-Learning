# Machine-Learning
This repository contains the collection of Datasets (real-life) and machine learning codes + algorithms.

## House price prediction 
I have download the dataset from the kaggle and I used the Multiple linear regression and xgboost as a supervised learning technic.
Evaluation Metric :  Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE):0.459107

## Diabetes prediction using SVM
 Datasets gained from kaggle and I have used 80% data for model training and 20% form testing.
 Model has the accuracy of 84.24 for both testing and training accuracy
